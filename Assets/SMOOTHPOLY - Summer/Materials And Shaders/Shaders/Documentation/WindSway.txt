This shader works by moving objects vertices from UVs. It moves vertices along X-axes.


Shader properties:

BaseColor: Choose the albedo texture map.
Wind Movement: Only X axes is affected. You can change the speed/amount of wind movement.
Wind density: You can change the wind density to change different parts to move more locally or to move as unit.
Wind Strength: Tweak this value to more heavily move the grass.
Metallic: This controls shaders metallic value.
Smoothness: Control smoothness
